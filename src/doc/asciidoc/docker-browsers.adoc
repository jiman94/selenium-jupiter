== Docker browsers 

As of version 2.0.0, _Selenium-Jupiter_ allows to ask for browsers in https://www.docker.com/[Docker] containers. The only requirement to use this feature is to install https://www.docker.com/get-docker[Docker Engine] in the machine running the tests. Internally, _Selenium-Jupiter_ uses a https://github.com/spotify/docker-client[docker-client] and different Docker images for browsers, namely:

* Stable versions of Docker browser, provided by https://aerokube.com/selenoid/latest/[Selenoid].
* Beta and nightly versions of Docker browser, provided by https://elastest.io/[ElasTest].
* Browsers in Android devices, provided by https://github.com/butomo1989/docker-android[Budi Utomo].

As shown in the following section, the mode of operation is similar to local browser. We simply asks for browsers in Docker simply declaring parameters in our `@Test` methods, and _Selenium-Jupiter_ will make magic for us: it downloads the proper Docker image for the browser, start it, and instantiate the object of type `WebDriver` or `RemoteWebDriver` to control the browser from our test. The annotation `@DockerBrowser` need to be declared in the parameter to mark the WebDriver object as a browser in Docker.    

=== Chrome

The following example contains a simple test example using Chrome browsers in Docker. Check out the code https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/docker/DockerChromeJupiterTest.java[here]. As you can see, the first `@Test` method (called `testChrome`) declares a parameter of type `RemoteWebDriver`. This parameter is annotated with `@DockerBrowser`. This annotation requires to set the browser type, in this case `CHROME`. If no version is specified, then the latest version of the browser will be used. This feature is known as *_evergreen_ Docker browsers*, and it is implementing by consuming the REST API of https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub], asking for the list of https://hub.docker.com/u/selenoid/[Selenoid] browsers. On the other hand, the second `@Test` (called `testChromeWithVersion`) a fixed version is set, in this case `67.0`.

----

In this other example, wildcards are used to set the browser version. In the first `@Test` (method `testLatestChrome`), we use the literal `latest` to mark the use of the latest version (in fact the use of `latest` is exactly the same that not declaring the `version` attribute). The second `@Test` (method `testFormerChrome`) sets the version as `latest-1`. This should be read as _latest version minus one_, in other words, the previous version to the stable version at the time of the test execution. Notice that the concrete versions for both test will evolve in time, since new versions are released constantly. All in all, you have the certainty of using the latest versions of the browser without any kind of extra configuration nor maintenance of the underlying infrastructure. 

Moreover, in third (`testBetaChrome`) and fourth (`testUnstableChrome`) test **beta** and **unstable** (i.e. development) versions are used. This feature is available both for https://hub.docker.com/r/elastestbrowsers/chrome/[Chrome] and https://hub.docker.com/r/elastestbrowsers/firefox/[Firefox], thanks to the Docker images provided by the http://elastest.io/[ElasTest project].

----

NOTE: The label _latest-*_ is supported, where _*_ is a number for a former version to the current stable. For instance, _latest-2_ means the two previous version to the stable (for instance, if at the time of running a test the latest version is 63.0, _latest-2_ will mean version 61.0).


NOTE: As of version 3.2.2, _Selenium-Jupiter_ allows to define an array of volumes to be mounted in the Docker container using syntax `"\local\path:\container\path"`. The character `~` can be used to specify the home user directory in the local host, and the the character `.` is used to specify the current folder in the local host. For example: `@DockerBrowser(type = CHROME, volumes = {"~:/home/selenium" }) WebDriver driver`. 

=== Firefox

The use of Firefox is equivalent. With respect to the previous example, it simply change the type of browser. Versioning works exactly the same.

[source,java]

include::../../test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/docker/DockerFirefoxJupiterTest.java[tags=snippet-in-doc,indent=0]
----

NOTE: Notice that the version of the second test is simply `64`. The actual version of the image is `64.0`, but _Selenium-Jupiter_ supposes that version is `.0` if not specified.

=== Opera

Again, the use of Opera browsers in Docker is the same, simply changing the browser type to `OPERA`.

----

=== Edge

_Selenium-Jupiter_ can be used to control a Microsoft Edge browser in a Docker container. Due to licensing issues, the required Docker image is not available in Docker Hub, and it must be built in local, following the https://github.com/aerokube/windows-images[tutorial provided by Aerokube]. If that tutorial is followed step by step, a Docker image named `windows/edge:18` will be available in the local machine. Then, _Selenium-Jupiter_ can be used to control the Edge browser as follows:

include::../../test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/docker/DockerEdgeJupiterTest.java[tags=snippet-in-doc,indent=0]
----

=== Internet Explorer

The same way than Edge, _Selenium-Jupiter_ can also be used to control a Internet Explorer browser in a Docker container. This time, the https://github.com/aerokube/windows-images[tutorial provided by Aerokube] need to be used to build the `windows/ie:11` image. Then, _Selenium-Jupiter_ uses that image, for example as follows:

----

=== Android

The use of browser devices in _Selenium-Jupiter_ is straightforward. Simply change the browser type to `ANDROID` as follows.

[source,java]
----
include::../../test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/android/AndroidJupiterTest.java[tags=snippet-in-doc,indent=0]
----

The supported Android devices are summarized in the following table:

.Android devices in _Selenium-Jupiter_
[width="100%",options="header"]
|==========================
|Android version| API level | Browser name
|5.0.1| 21 | `browser`
|5.1.1| 22 | `browser`
|6.0| 23 | `chrome`
|7.0| 24 | `chrome`
|7.1.1| 25 | `chrome`
|8.0| 26 | `chrome`
|8.1| 27 | `chrome`
|9.0| 28 | `chrome`
|==========================

Moreover, the type of devices are the following:

=== Remote sessions (VNC)

_Selenium-Jupiter_ allows to track the evolution of our browsers in Docker using Virtual Network Computing (VNC) sessions. This feature is disabled by default, but it can activated using the configuration key `sel.jup.vnc`  to `true` (more info on section link:#configuration[Configuration]).

When it is activated, the VNC URL of a browser in Docker is printed in the test log, concretely using the _DEBUG_ level (see example below). Simply copying and pasting that URL in a real browser we can take a look to the browser while the test is being executed. We can even interact with the Docker browser.

NOTE: In addition to log the VNC URL, as of _Selenium-Jupiter_ 2.1.0, the value of this URL is exported as Java property as `vnc.session.url` (i.e. `System.setProperty("vnc.session.url", vncUrl);`).

=== Recordings

_Selenium-Jupiter_ allows to record the sessions of browsers in Docker. This capability is not activated by default, but it activated simply setting the configuration key `sel.jup.recording` to `true` (see section link:#configuration[Configuration] for further details about configuration).

This way, a recording in MP4 format will be stored at the end of the test which uses one or several browsers in Docker. The output folder in which the recording is stored is configured by means of the configuration key `sel.jup.output.folder`, whose default value is `.` (i.e. the current folder in which the test is executed). The following picture shows an example of recording.

=== Performance tests

Another important new feature of browsers in Docker is the possibility of asking for _many of them_ by the same test. This can be used to implement performance tests in a seamless way. To use this feature, we need into account two aspects. First of all, the attribute `size` of the annotation `@DockerBrowser` should be declared. This numeric value sets the number of browsers demanded by the test. Second, the test declares a `List<RemoteWebDriver>` (or `List<WebDriver>`). For example as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::../../test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/docker/PerformenceDockerChromeJupiterTest.java[tags=snippet-in-doc,indent=0]
----

This example requires a list of 3 Chrome browsers in Docker. Then, it executed in parallel a given logic. Notice that if the number of browsers is high, the CPU and memory consumption of the test running the machine will increase accordingly.


=== Selenide

Browsers in Docker containers can be also controlled using Selenide very easily in _Selenium-Jupiter_. As usual, we need to declare `SelenideDriver` parameters in our test (or constructor), but this time annotated also with `@DockerBrowser`. For example, the following class implements two tests. The first one use the latest version of Chrome and the second test uses the beta version of Firefox. Both browsers are executed in Docker containers, and their versions (latest and beta) are figured out in test runtime in a transparent way for developers. Then, in the tests logic, we control the browsers in Docker containers using the fluent Selenide API.

[source,java]
----
include::../../test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/selenide/SelenideDockerJupiterTest.java[tags=snippet-in-doc,indent=0]
----

As usual, we can use the remote access with VNC or the recording capabilities provided by _Selenium-Jupiter_ when using Docker. In the example before, we enable the remote access by VNC.
