== Local browsers

https://seleniumhq.github.io/docs/site/en/webdriver/[Selenium WebDriver] allows to control different types of browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and so on) programmatically using different programming languages. This is very useful to implement automated tests for web applications. Nevertheless, in order to use WebDriver, we need to pay a prize. For security reasons, the automated manipulation of a browser can only be done using native features of the browser. In practical terms, it means that a binary file must be placed in between the test using the WebDriver API and the actual browser. One the one hand, the communication between the WebDriver object and that binary is done using the (https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/)[W3C WebDriver specification], formerly called _JSON Wire Protocol_. It consists basically on a REST service using JSON for requests and responses. On the other hand, the communication between the binary and the browser is done using native capabilities of the browser. Therefore, the general schema of Selenium WebDriver can be illustrated as follows:

From a tester point of view, the need of this binary component is a pain in the neck, since it should be downloaded manually for the proper platform running the test (i.e. Windows, Linux, Mac). Moreover, the binary version should be constantly updated. The majority of browsers evolve quite fast, and the corresponding binary file required by WebDriver needs to be also updated. The following picture shows a fine-grained diagram of the different flavor of WebDriver binaries and browsers:

Concerning Java, in order to locate these drivers, the absolute path of the binary controlling the browser should be exported in a given environment variable before creating a WebDriver instance, as follows:

[source,java]
----
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/path/to/chromedriver");
System.setProperty("webdriver.opera.driver", "/path/to/operadriver");
System.setProperty("webdriver.ie.driver", "C:/path/to/IEDriverServer.exe");
System.setProperty("webdriver.edge.driver", "C:/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe");
System.setProperty("phantomjs.binary.path", "/path/to/phantomjs");
System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", "/path/to/geckodriver");
----

In order to simplify the life of Java WebDriver users, in March 2015 the utility https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager[WebDriverManager] was first released. WebDriverManager is a library which automates all this process (download the proper binary and export the proper variable) for Java in runtime. The WebDriverManager API is quite simple, providing a singleton object for each of the above mentioned browsers:

[source,java]
----
WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.firefoxdriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.operadriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.phantomjs().setup();
WebDriverManager.edgedriver().setup();
WebDriverManager.iedriver().setup();;
----

The solution implemented by WebDriverManager is today supported by similar tools for other languages, such as https://github.com/angular/webdriver-manager[webdriver-manager] for *Node.js* or https://github.com/rosolko/WebDriverManager.Net[WebDriverManager.Net] for *.NET*.

On September 2017, a new major version of the well-know testing JUnit framework was released. This leads to *_Selenium-Jupiter_*, which can be seen as the natural evolution of _WebDriverManager_ for *JUnit 5* tests. Internally, _Selenium-Jupiter_ is built using two foundations:

1. It uses _WebDriverManager_ to manage the binaries requires by WebDriver.
2. It uses the _dependency injection_ feature of the extension model of JUnit 5 to inject WebDriver objects within `@Test` methods.

All in all, using Selenium WebDriver to control browsers using Java was never that easy. Using JUnit 5 and _Selenium-Jupiter_, you simply need to declare the flavor of browser you want to use in your test method (or constructor) and use it.

=== Chrome

The following example contains a simple usage of Chrome in JUnit 5. The complete source code of this test is hosted on https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/basic/ChromeJupiterTest.java[GitHub]. Notice that this class contains two tests (methods annotated with `@Test`). The first one (`testWithOneChrome`) declares just one `ChromeDriver` parameter, and therefore this test controls a single Chrome browser. On the other hand, the second `@Test` (`testWithTwoChromes`) declares two different `ChromeDriver` parameters, and so, it controls two Chrome browsers.

=== Firefox

The following https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/basic/FirefoxJupiterTest.java[test] uses Firefox as browser(s). To that aim, `@Test` methods simply need to include `FirefoxDriver` parameters.

=== Opera

Are you one of the few using Opera? No problem, you can still make automated  https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/basic/OperaJupiterTest.java[tests] with JUnit 5, WebDriver, and _Selenium-Jupiter_, as follows:

----

=== Edge

The following https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/basic/EdgeJupiterTest.java[example] uses one Edge browser. This test should be executed on a Windows machine with Edge.

=== Internet Explorer

The following https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/basic/IExplorerJupiterTest.java[example] uses one Internet Explorer browser. This test should be executed on a Windows machine with Internet Explorer.

=== Safari

You can also use https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/basic/SafariJupiterTest.java[Safari] in conjunction with _Selenium-Jupiter_. Take into account that `SafariDriver` requires Safari 10 running on OSX El Capitan or greater.

=== PhamtomJS

PhamtomJS is a headless browser (i.e. a browser without GUI), and it can be convenient for different types of tests.  The following https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/basic/PhantomjsJupiterTest.java[example] demonstrates how to use PhamtomJS with _Selenium-Jupiter_.

=== HtmlUnit

HtmlUnit is another headless browser that can be used easily in a Jupiter test, for https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/basic/HtmlUnitJupiterTest.java[example] like this:

=== Selenide

As of version 3.3.0 _Selenium-Jupiter_ provides seamless integration with *Selenide*, which is a high-level testing framework which defines a fluent API on the top of Selenium WebDriver. For more information, take a look to https://selenide.org/[Selenide website].

In order to use a local browser with Selenide in _Selenium-Jupiter_ we follow the same philosophy than in other browsers. Using the JUnit 5 dependency injection mechanism, we simply need to declare `SelenideDriver` parameters in our test (or constructor) parameters. _Selenium-Jupiter_ will instantiate properly the objects, making them available for the test(s). Then, we simply need to invoke the Selenide API in our test body to assess some web under test.

Take a look to the following example. By default, a `SelenideDriver` object use Chrome driver. Therefore, the following test use the local Chrome browser (installed in the machine running the test) with Selenide:

[source,java]
----
include::../../test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/selenide/SelenideDefaultJupiterTest.java[tags=snippet-in-doc,indent=0]
----

Besides, _Selenium-Jupiter_ provides the annotation `@SelenideConfiguration` to configure `SelenideDriver` objects. This annotation can be used at parameter-level (i.e. to configure a single object) or field-level (i.e. to configure all the objects within a test class). The following test shows a couple of example of parameter-level configuration. The first test use a Firefox browser in headless mode. On the other hand, the second test uses two different browsers in the same test: Chrome and Firefox.

[source,java]
----
include::../../test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/selenide/SelenideParameterConfigJupiterTest.java[tags=snippet-in-doc,indent=0]
----

The annotation `@SelenideConfiguration` can also be used to configure globally Selenide in a test class by annotating fields of the type `SelenideConfig`, for example as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::../../test/java/io/github/bonigarcia/seljup/test/selenide/SelenideGlobalConfigJupiterTest.java[tags=snippet-in-doc,indent=0]
----

NOTE: Chrome options (arguments and preferences) and Firefox profiles can be configure in Selenide using JVM properties using the command line as `-Dchromeoptions.args=,...`, `-Dchromeoptions.prefs=,...`, and `-Dfirefoxprofile.=,`.
